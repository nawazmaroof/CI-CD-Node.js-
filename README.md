# Node.js CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions. The pipeline performs the following tasks:

1. Automated testing on pull requests to ensure that all tests pass before merging.
2. Docker image build and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster on the `main` branch.
3. Slack notifications on the status of deployments, whether successful or failed.

## Setup Instructions

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Set up your DockerHub and Kubernetes cluster credentials.
3. Add your secrets to GitHub:
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` for Docker login.
   - `KUBE_CONFIG` for Kubernetes access.
   - `SLACK_TOKEN` for Slack notifications.
4. Push changes to the repository and the CI/CD pipeline will automatically run.
